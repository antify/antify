# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Antify

Antify is a headless multitenancy administration based on Nuxt 3 and MongoDB. It ships with basic features to run a SaaS app, such as user administration, invoicing, protected document management, and much more.

You can use the ready-to-go administration and extend it with the [Nuxt 3 layer system](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/layers), or build your own and use only the parts you need by installing the antify modules instead.
